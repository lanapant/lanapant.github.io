Apple watch announcement made headlines on every news broadcasting network,on any tech blog, the apple stock price jumped tremendously. Everyone is going crazy about the apple watch and when the product will be delivered on the store shelves no doubt we will see lines of people lining up to get new toy.
##Will the Apple watch replace the traditional watch?

It won't ! First of all people buy watches as tracking time jewelry piece. We wear it and we forgot that we are wearing it! With the apple watch try to forget about it when you are taking a shower or jump to swimming pool. The apple watch is water resistant ( means can tolerate splashes of water ), but it is not waterproof! It is like wearing a phone on your wrist with limited apps.

##Why do we need a watch that we have to charge it every 18 hours, when it is painful to change battery for traditional watch once a year?
Apple watch owners have to charge their device every single night if they want to last through next day. Think how many devices we charge every day and if we forget to do so, we are facing low battery issue and frustration it brings in us. In addition to charging our phone, laptop, tablet, do we really need to add a watch?
##Sorry if you don't have iPhone, forget about apple watch.
The device will sync all the data through wireless network but the apps,designed to work with an iPhone will be useless. So there is solution, put an “apple” on every device you have or forget about the apple watch.
##And the last thing – the price...
The price of the watch is close to the price of the phone itself or even more expensive. The price range if from  $349 and all the way to $17,000 !
