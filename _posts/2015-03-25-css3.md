In the past, if we wanted rounded corners, there were only a few solutions available. 

-  load four images, one for each corner, and add some extra markup to get them to line up (and try to make it work in all browsers).

-  implement some kind of  multiple div tags to "draw" a rounded border. Or one of a half a dozen other ways. In the end none of them were great solutions.

So why we need to use rounded corners ? Because users are attracted to them and they just seem to make your design look more natural.
Rounded corners are ridiculously easy to add to elements using CSS3's new border-radius property. 

If you want each corner to have the same border radius, just give it one value, like this: 
border-radius: 50%; (we get a perfect circle, when width and height have same value)

If you want to set each corner of the border to a different radius, you can do that too. The values are in the standard order for CSS properties, clockwise from the top-left: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left. 
border-radius: 1px 60px 8px 90px ;

You may set one, two, three, or all four values. If two values are set, the first applies to top-left and bottom-right and the second applies to top-right and bottom-left. So it's opposite corners. Â‹ If three values are set, the second value applies to top-right and bottom-left. The first applies to top-left and the third to bottom-right. 
You can also define each corner's radius separately, as shown here:

border-top-left-radius: 1px; 

border-top-right-radius: 60px; 

border-bottom-right-radius: 8px; 

border-bottom-left-radius: 90px;
