title:  Web Development is NOT web design.
---
One of the biggest misunderstandings is that web development is the same as the web design, which is not true.Web development is taking the designer's work and turning it into a functional website.  We should consider that designers are the creative individuals who are focused on the overall look and feel of a website; while developers are the individuals who concentrate on the general performance aspects of the site.

##Web developers do more than just write code.

Big part of the job of web developers is analyzing website performance and creating strategies to improve web site performance. It's a part of the job of every developer to spend a great deal of time researching new techniques and technologies. Web developers never done learning. New scripts, widgets and designs are released daily so web developers must stay up to date if they want to be successful in the industry. Web developers are never satisfied and web site is never “finished”.
