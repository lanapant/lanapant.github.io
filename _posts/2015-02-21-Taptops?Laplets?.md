# It is time for Hybrids

Hybrid computers became very popular recently.  They are convertible , detachable, and come with keyboards.  They always sounded better than they actually were.  That's because they always were very pricey.  Most hybrid computers were either powerful ( huge and heavy) or slim ( light and useless because of they were underpowered) . Hybrids devices could never really serve as a primary computer till now.


In October 2014, Intel launched the M processor, that allows to draw less than half the power without sacrificing performance. Less power consumption means less heat, so there is no need for active cooling.  As a result, a number of companies launched lightweight, fanless hybrid devices that can replace our regular laptops.
