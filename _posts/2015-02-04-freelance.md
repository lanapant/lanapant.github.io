##1.Stay up to date with technology changes

Today, technological changes happen on a daily basis. As a web developer it is essential to keep up with information regarding new web design tools and even software, that can help you better do your work and land well-paying contracts. 

##2. Charge the Right Prices.

Pricing is very important for freelance web designers. Many people turn to freelance web designers, because they are not willing to pay large amount of money for the services offered by large web design companies. As a result, as web developer you need to be fair in your charges  - not expensive , so that you do not scare away potential customer, as well not under priced.

##3. Fixed End Time for All Projects.

When you signed a contract with a client, the customer has own expectations of you. One of such expectations is that you finish the job on time. To avoid running late, it's crucial to set own fixed end time for all the projects. This time should always be lesser than the client gave you, so you can deliver the project earlier to surprise your customer. This will show how professional you are which can lead to more jobs through referrals.
