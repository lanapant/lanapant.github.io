We all know Angelina Jolie as the one most beautiful female actress in the world. She is admired as human activist, as a  movie star,  as a mother and wife.  But we did not know about her struggle with health .

In 2013, Angelina Jolie  published article in the New York Times where she opened a reason of her disappearance in movie industry in 2013 period. She  had a preventive  double  mastectomy (A mastectomy is surgery to remove the entire breast, including the skin and nipple. It is usually done to treat).  She wanted to  let people know her reasons , that are behind this operation. Angelina’s mother died of breast cancer. Angelina is a mother of five, and she doesn’t want to put her kids through losing their mother in such early age. She wrote in her article in 2013, she will do anything to prevent cancer, she will fight with no fear.

Two days ago, Angelina published another article in The New York Times – “Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary of a Surgery”. She informed users of the removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes. This procedure puts woman in forced menopause. Angelina would not be able to give birth to another baby anymore. But with this procedure she reduces her chances to get ovarian cancer in a future.

Angelina’s stories are very honest, and hopefully they will be helpful to another woman who are suffering with cancer.
