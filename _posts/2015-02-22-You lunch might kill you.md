Your lunch might kill you …
We all like sandwiches. They are quick, economical and most importantly, delicious. Do you remember your lunch box when you were in school? Fruits and sandwiches kept us going through classes and stressful school days. Now we have no time to sit down and eat a proper lunch. We grab a sandwich and we don’t think how harmful it can be to our health. 

A recent USDA study found that sandwich sodium content has gotten out of control. A large steak sub from Quiznos, contains 4,320 mg of sodium, almost twice daily limit of 2,300 mg. The excessive sodium in oversized portions of processed cheeses, meats, and bread raises blood pressure and, along with it, the risk of heart disease.


Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack (Center for disease control and prevention study). Do not think that a heart attack is only common to people after 60. It’s became common for people of younger age to have it. Always think about what you eat as it is your future investment in your health from an early age. Go back to your grandma's sandwiches with two slices of bread with just a few slices of low-sodium deli meat and do not skip the vegetables.
