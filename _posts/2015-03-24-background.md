Background images are very important for a web site. They make design look more attractive, and appealing to a user. Therefore it is important to know how to position images in right way, so it doesn't ruin  the website's overall appearance.  

You can set the size of a background image to either a fixed pixel amount or a percentage of the area of the element. The image will be scaled to fit in the area specified. The background-size property takes two values: a horizontal size and a vertical size.

If you want a background image to fill the entire background of an element, you can use the following: background-size: 100% 100%;

You can specify multiple background images by separating them with commas. The first image in the list will be drawn on top and the last will be drawn on the bottom. The following draws two background images: background: url(bg-front.png), url(bg-back.png); 
There is also a new background-origin property that determines where the background image is drawn.

The possible values are as follows: 

 content-box: (Draws the background image only in the content area of an element )

 padding-box: (Draws the background image out into the padding area of an element )
 
 border-box: (Draws the background image all the way out into the border of an element)
