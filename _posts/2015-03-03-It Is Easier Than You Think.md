Nowadays, if an online business doesnâ€™t accept credit cards, the chances are it will lose customers to competitors who do. The growth of ecommerce websites over the past years has made the process of setting up credit card accounts fairly simple. These are the things you should know about the acceptance of credit cards on your web site.

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/home), [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/), [Cybersource](http://www.cybersource.com/) and [Verisign](http://www.verisign.com/) are services that process credit card transactions. They are called payment getaways. How do they work? It is very straightforward: when a customer purchases a product or a service from you website, they enter credit card number during the checkout process. You website sends those credit card numbers to your payment gateway where the transaction is authorized and the payment processed. If the payments are approved, your payment gateway transfers the money from the customers' account in to your account. The payment gateway services are not free. The typical fees for a small business account (less than 1,000 transactions) can range from $10 to $100, in addition to fees of 2 and 5 percent per transaction.

It important to know, that as an online business owner you have to have a merchant account, which can be obtained through a bank. A merchant account is an online bank account that holds your money temporarily until it's moved into your actual bank account. In other words, a merchant account is a sort of a holding tank.
