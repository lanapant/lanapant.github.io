We all tend to buy things that are the newest on the market. We like technology and we depend on it. We want a coffee maker that brews coffee at a set time.  We want cameras in our home so we can check from any location who opened the door. We want everything to be controlled by our smartphone so we can see and control with a click of a button. “The Internet of Things” is the network of physical objects  embedded with electronics, software and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer or other connected devices. It sounds so tempting to have full control over our electronics, but there is a danger

In the late summer of 2006, McDonald launched a promotional campaign in Japan to boost sales. The campaign offered a code to every Coca Cola buyer that you could submit on their website for a chance to win an MP3 player and free songs. So, 10,000 lucky winners of MP3 players plugged their new devices to computers and a Trojan horse slipped undetected into their systems and began collecting passwords, and gathering personal data. The problem is - every device (phones, cars, refrigerators, planes etc.) has microchips, and they are almost entirely unsecured. So do not be surprised when your fridge turn on you … The Internet of Things gives us control and freedom, but we always should remember this is a new weapon. We all remember threats made by hackers to Sony and what happened. We do not need guns and bullets to fight and threaten people anymore. All we need is hacking skills.
