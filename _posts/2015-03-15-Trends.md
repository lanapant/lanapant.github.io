Google Trends is one of the best and free tools available for Search Engine Optimization. It is based on Google search, that shows how often a particular word or group of words is entered to the total search-volume across various regions of the worlds, and in various languages. 

##Working with Google Trends.

When performing a search on Google Trends, you can set four parameters :

**Web Search** – Image Search - News Search – YouTube Search – Product Search

**Worldwide**  or specific country

**Timeline :**  2004-present , Past 7 Days, Past 30 days, By a Specific Year, or simply by using the dates

**Categories :** All, Recommended, or specific categories like Arts & Entertainment, Beauty & Fitness and etc. 

###You can compare up to five search terms or grouping at one time 

*Use + sign between your search terms.*

For example:

cat + kittens + litter ( group 1)

web development + web design + SEO ( group 2)


##Geographical Targeting

Google Trends allows to break down the search data by region. Your business can benefit from this information. 

For example :

Your business offers custom t-shirts that are made from organic material. What region should you target  ? Where you have more chances to increase your sales?
