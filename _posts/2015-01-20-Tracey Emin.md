Tracey Emin is an English artist. She is part of the group known as Britartists or YBAs (Young British Artists).



## Her most famous work :

###Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 ("The Tent")

Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 was a tent appliquéd with 102 names of the people she had slept with up to the time of its creation in 1995.[2] The title is often misinterpreted as a euphemism indicating sexual partners and the work termed "a list of all the people that Emin has ever had sex with", but is in fact intended more inclusively.

*"The Tent" was sold for $60 000*

###My Bed, 1998

The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the fact that the bedsheets were stained with bodily secretions and the floor had items from the artist's room (such as condoms, a pair of knickers with menstrual period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects, including a pair of slippers). The bed was presented in the state that Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship difficulties.

*"My Bed" was sold in 2014 for $3.7 million*
