title: Casa Natura 100% Natural Floor Cleaner 
---

CasaNatura is a new line of cleaning solutions for households. It is a relatively new company that just entered the market in South Florida. All the products are 100% natural and there are no harsh chemicals or smell in the products. 
We decided to test Casa Natura Floor Cleaner. It comes in three scents: pine, lavender, and jasmine gardenia. The product comes in a 33.8 fl oz. bottle. The price is only $3.89.The cleaning solution itself (pine) is green. We tested Casa Natura Floor Cleaner on wood floor. It works like any other cleaner, doesnâ€™t leave any marks on the floor and performs according to its purpose. What makes this product different from others that we used before is that there is no strong smell to it. It solves the problem of inhaling toxic chemicals such as ammonia while cleaning the house. The product is perfect for people with allergies who are sensitive to strong scents. This floor cleaner helps to improve our health and the environment.Casa Natura uses eco-friendly formula in all  products. It doesn't harm the environment because it is completely biodegradable including the bottle. It is also phosphate free which helps keep our rivers and lakes healthy.
