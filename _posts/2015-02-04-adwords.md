Google is the largest search engine on the Internet, and to use the Internet as a profit-making source, one needs to use Google.  It's an online advertising tool that places advertising message on the top of the list of search results Google displays for a particular search query. Google AdWords makes your marketing task a whole lot easier by bringing huge per click traffic through the use of proper keywords. When these keywords convert to business and sales, the traffic driven from Google AdWords is converted to profit. 

Google AdWords can bring  success to your business and earn profit, but there is many factors that should be considered. One of the most important factor is selecting proper keywords. Keywords are search terms or strings of search terms that when put in the search box show results relevant to that search. For example, a person searching for “dental office” will get more than 1000 search results in the search engine, and the user can click on any of the items to view the results and details. However, the top search results that come through Google AdWords have greater chances of visits.
